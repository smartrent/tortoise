  A dynamic supervisor that can hold `Tortoise311.Connection` processes

  A `Tortoise311.Supervisor`, registered under the name
  `Tortoise311.Supervisor`, is started as part of the `Tortoise311.App`,
  which will get started automatically when `Tortoise311` is included as
  a `Mix` dependency. Spawning a connection on the
  `Tortoise311.Supervisor` can be done as follows:

      {:ok, pid} =
        Tortoise311.Supervisor.start_child(
          client_id: T1000,
          handler: {Tortoise311.Handler.Logger, []},
          server: {Tortoise311.Transport.Tcp, host: 'localhost', port: 1883},
          subscriptions: [{"foo/bar", 0}]
        )

  While this is an easy way to get started one should consider the
  supervision strategy of the application using the
  `Tortoise311.Connection`s. Often one would like to close the connection
  with the application using the connection, in which case one could
  consider starting the `Tortoise311.Connection` directly in the
  supervisor of the application using the connection, or start a
  `Tortoise311.Supervisor` as part of ones application if it require more
  than one connection.

  See the *Connection Supervision* article in the project
  documentation for more information on connection supervision.
